## Objective
The objective of this project is to develope a predictive model to estimate the future sales of video games based on sales data and various features such as title,platform,genre,publisher,critic score,user score,total shipped units,production cost and release year.
Using those datas available we will predict the global sales of video games.
## Dataset

-North American Sales : The total sales revenue generated in North America
-European Sales : The total sales revenue generated in European countries
-Japan Sales : The total sales revenue generated in Japan
-Global Sales : The total sales revenue generated globally.
-Production Cost : The cost incurred for developing and producing the video game.
-Release Year : The year in which the video game was released.
