## Objective
The objective of this project is to develope a predictive model to estimate the future sales of video games based on sales data and various features such as title,platform,genre,publisher,critic score,user score,total shipped units,production cost and release year.
Using those datas available we can predict the global sales of video games.
## Tools and Libraries
The tools and libraries we used are :
- Sklearn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of the following columns:
- Title : The title or name of the video game.
- Platform : The gaming platform or console on which the game is released(eg., PC, PS, PS2, etc..).
- Genre : The genre or category of the video game(eg., adventure, sports, racing, etc..)
- Publisher : The company that publishes the video game.
- VG Score : The video game score or rating provided by video game magazines or websites.
- Critic Score : The rating given by game critics.
- User Score : The rating given by users or gamers.
- Total Shipped : The total number of units shipped.
- Aisan Sales : The total sales revenue generated in Aisan countries
- North American Sales : The total sales revenue generated in North America
- European Sales : The total sales revenue generated in European countries
- Japan Sales : The total sales revenue generated in Japan
- Global Sales : The total sales revenue generated globally.
- Production Cost : The cost incurred for developing and producing the video game.
- Release Year : The year in which the video game was released.
